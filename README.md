## üèÖ Challenge <a id="challenge"></a>

## Challenge Description  

The current situation shows that the support database no longer meets operational needs: it does not fully guarantee compliance with the law, does not provide enough clarity for audits, and does not facilitate historical or predictive analysis. This means reports end up being rigid and repetitive, without giving a complete view for decision-makers. The modernization proposal seeks to address these limitations, bringing more security in data handling, transparency in monitoring actions, and dashboards that help every level of the team ‚Äî from analysts to managers and strategic stakeholders ‚Äî to visualize exactly the information they need to work more efficiently.  

---

## üèÖ Solution <a id="solution"></a>

LuminIA is an integrated AI-powered dashboard carefully developed to facilitate and optimize management decision-making, while continuously supporting analysts in handling tickets. With strategic insights and AI reinforcement, LuminIA transforms complex information into concrete actions, making the entire support process more efficient, agile, intelligent, and aligned with business needs. All of this is provided through a modern, intuitive, and easy-to-use tool, designed so managers and analysts can quickly access data.
